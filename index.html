        <h2>There are countless books about designing for the web.</h2> 
        <p>They all give multiple routes, options, and solutions to solving design problems.</p>
        <p>Many of them are <strong>plain wrong</strong>.</p>
        <p>This has led to an entire generation of designers failing to make interfaces that are usable, software that’s intuitive, and products that normal people can understand.</p>
    
        <h2>101 UX Opinions changes that with 101 ways to solve 101 UX problems clearly and single-mindedly.</h2>

        <p>The 101 principles are opinionated. They’ll rub some designers up the wrong way. But these principles are rooted in 20 years of building for the web. They’re not based on theory, they’re based on practice.</p>
        
        <p>Simply put: they’ve been proven to work at scale. There’s no arguing with that.</p>

        <h2>Who's Will Grant to say design principles are wrong?</h2>

        <p>Will is a web technology entrepreneur with 20+ years’​ experience leading teams and products at the intersection of technology and usability. Will is a self-confessed ‘design purist’ and usability nerd, obsessed with making interfaces usable and customers happy.</p>

        <p>After his Computer Science degree, Will trained with Jakob Nielsen and Bruce Tognazzini (Nielsen Norman Group) - the world leaders in usable design.</p>
        
        <p>Will has been building intuitive, usable software products since the birth of the consumer web over 20 years ago - through to the present day where Will's work has reached more than a billion users.</p>
